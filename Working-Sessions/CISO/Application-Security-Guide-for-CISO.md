https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Application_Security_Guide_For_CISOs

Among application security stakeholders, Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) are responsible for application security from governance, compliance and risk perspectives. This guide seeks to help CISOs manage application security programs according to CISO roles, responsibilities, perspectives and needs. Application security best practices and OWASP resources are referenced throughout this guide. OWASP is a non profit organization whose mission is "making application security visible and empowering application security stakeholders with the right information for managing application security risks".

## Why

The main purpose of the Application Security Guide for CISO is to help information security professionals whose responsibility is to deliver and manage application security programs including security in the SDLC (S-SDLC) visibility of OWASP mission and available OWASP resources (e.g. awareness guidelines, maturity models, top vulnerability research and testing guides and tools) =that can be leveraged helping them deliver and manage security in the SDLC (S-SDLC) processes

## What

The OWASP CISO guide provides a framework that can be used to manage application security programs including software security from governance, risk and compliance perspective.

Specifically the guide helps to translate of vulnerability technical risks into business risks helping information security managers to communicate the risk posed by insecure web and mobile applications including exploits of vulnerabilities from threats due to emerging technologies and exposure to cyber-threats targeting web and mobile security digital assets.

The guide provides a framework helping CISOs to navigate through the rich pool of OWASP resources in order to deliver and manage application security programs such as:
•	Using guidelines for measuring and managing the maturity of software security practices within the organization such as by using OWASP SAMM
•	Incorporate security requirements in the design of web and mobile applications to make sure products and services offered to comply with information security standards policies as well as data privacy regulations
•	Drive software development and engineering teams toward OWASP resources that can be used for security reviews of source code and vulnerability testing such as OWASP coding guides, testing guides and application security testing tools and other OWASP resources for training & awareness 
•	Manage web and mobile application vulnerability risks (OWASP Top Ten) including emerging technology risks (e.g. cloud security Software As a Service, web services) by communicating vulnerability risk exposure in terms of possible impacts to the business such as loss of data confidentiality, integrity and availability as well as of the services being provided to customers in terms of estimates of monetary losses and reputational damage


## Who

The target audience are information security professionals whose responsibility is to deliver and manage application security programs including security in the SDLC (S-SDLC) such as information security officers in senior management roles including technology managers/directors responsible to manage software and application security.
